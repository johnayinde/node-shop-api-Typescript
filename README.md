## How to Run

You will have to follow some steps to test the API.

### 1 - Install MongoDB

To run this project, you need to install the latest version of MongoDB Community Edition first.

### 2 - Install Node.js

Download and install Node.js. Make sure to download and install the latest stable version (LTS).

To check if Node.js was installed succesfully, run the following command in terminal or command prompt:

```node --version```

You should see an output like this:

```v10.13.0```

It indicates that Node.js is running.

### 3 - Install the API Dependencies

Open the project folder using the terminal or command prompt, then type the following:

```npm i```

The command above will install all node modules needed for the API to run. If you are using Linux or MacOS and receive a permission denied message, use ```sudo```.



### 4 - Running the Server

After following all steps above, you are ready to start the server. Type the following in the terminal or command prompt:

```node index.js```


Go ahead and play around with the API to check the available operations.
